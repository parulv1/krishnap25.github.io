 My wonderful grandmother -  who played the

I sing, and have learnt Hindustani classical singing for 4 years. At Purdue, I was part of a fusion band called Tatvam (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TatvamPurdue/">Facebook page</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBlDeRAwAAP_SeVPqmVi_HQ">YouTube channel</a>). Here are some videos from the shows we performed. For videos, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLpZ0h8WEPbwnDKhWJ_QUO6eF4m-cC1Rh">playlist</a> on my YouTube channel.
