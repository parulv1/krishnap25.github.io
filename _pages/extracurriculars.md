I am interested in the fusion of Western music with Indian Classical music.
 My wonderful grandmother -  who played the
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati_veena">Veena</a> - and I had quite a blast making some fusion music.

I sing, and have learnt Hindustani classical singing for 4 years. At Purdue, I was part of a fusion band called Tatvam (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/TatvamPurdue/">Facebook page</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBlDeRAwAAP_SeVPqmVi_HQ">YouTube channel</a>). Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLpZ0h8WEPbwnDKhWJ_QUO6eF4m-cC1Rh">playlist</a> on my YouTube channel for some of the performances by Tatvam. Here is a mashup we created:

I also performed while I was at IIT Bombay. Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLpZ0h8WEPbwACw-wThjfA_FNDyTm0a_1">playlist</a> for some of my previous recordings.  

* I was a member of <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~karate/">Purdue Karate Club</a>. We learnt Goju-Ryu style karate, and our dojo is recognized under <a href="http://www.tinoceberano-igk.com.au/tag/goju-kai/">Hanshi Tino Ceberano</a>. Currently, I am at 2nd Kyu and practising karate on my own.  

* I occassionally play squash. During my undergrad, I played basketball and was part of the Inter IIT basketball team.  

* I was also an active member of <a href="https://www.boilerlink.purdue.edu/organization/yesplus">Sky@Purdue</a> club as well. The focus of this club is mental health, and they organize various events and courses centered around breathing and meditation. The main breathing technique they teach is called Sudarshan Kriya, developed by <a href="https://www.srisriravishankar.org/life/biography/">Sri Sri Ravi Shankar</a>, founder of the <a href="https://artofliving.org/">Art of Living Foundation</a>. <a href="https://www.artofliving.org/us-en/research-sudarshan-kriya">Here</a>, you will find some research articles on the benefits of Sudarshan Kriya. I have also done other courses offered by Art of Living such as Sahaj Samadhi, Silence Retreat, and Vigyan Bhairav Discourse.  

* I also enjoy cooking. My signature dish is paneer puffs!
