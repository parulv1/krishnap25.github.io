I am a Ph.D student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. I am fortunate to be advised by [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/) and [Sham Kakade](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/).

I'm interested in machine learning and optimization broadly, and specifically in the setting of structued prediction.

Previously, I worked with [Nina Balcan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/) for my Master's at Carnegie Mellon University. 
Before that, I spent 4 wonderful years as an undergrad at IIT Bombay.
