I am a Ph.D candidate in the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering at the **Purdue University**. 
I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Doraiswami Ramkrishna](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ramkiites/).  

My thesis work is on predicting and understanding the mechanism of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a side-effect which manifests itself as a painful, numbing and tingling sensation felt in palm and feet. I also work on pain sensation, and investigate how some genetic mutations can shift pain sensation threshold. I use bifurcation theory, mathematical modeling and machine learning for my work. For details on my projects, check out my page on my [Projects](https://parulv1.github.io/projects).
