I am a PhD candidate in the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering at **Purdue University**. 
I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Doraiswami Ramkrishna](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ramkiites/).  

My thesis work is on predicting and understanding the mechanism of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a side-effect which manifests itself as a painful, numbing and tingling sensation felt in palm and feet. I also work on pain sensation, and investigate how some genetic mutations can shift pain sensation threshold. I use bifurcation theory, mathematical modeling, and machine learning for my work. [Here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Parul_Verma7) is my researchgate profile. 

Before joining Purdue, I obtained my Bachelor of Technology degree in Chemical Engineering from IIT Bombay. There, I carried out a research project on moment closure methods for TNF-alpha signaling model with [Dr. Ganesh Viswanathan](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/faculty/ganesh/index.html).
