I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Brain Networks Laboratory](https://radiology.ucsf.edu/research/labs/brain-networks-lab#-) at the Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging at **University of California, San Francisco** (UCSF). My PI is [Dr. Ashish Raj](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/ashish.raj), who specializes in using graph theory techniques to investigate the whole brain connectome. You can follow our lab's [twitter handle](https://twitter.com/RajLab_UCSF) for updates on our work. I am also funded by the [Alzheimer's Association](https://www.alz.org/) via a mentored postdoc fellowship grant to work on investigating brain dynamic functional activity in Alzheimer's disease, in collaboration with [UCSF Memory and Aging Center](https://memory.ucsf.edu/).   

Previously, I obtained my doctorate degree from the Davidson School of Chemical Engineering at **Purdue University**. 
I have been fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Doraiswami Ramkrishna](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ramkiites/), who specializes in mathematical modeling, in particular in using population balance modeling and cybernetic modeling. You can find the details of my disseration [here](https://hammer.figshare.com/articles/Towards_Understanding_Neuropathy_from_Cancer_Chemotherapy_and_Pathophysiology_of_Pain_Sensation_An_Engineering_Approach/12196746/1).    

My thesis work was on predicting and understanding the mechanism of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a side-effect which manifests itself as a painful, numbing and tingling sensation felt in palm and feet. I also worked on pain sensation, and investigated how some genetic mutations can shift pain sensation threshold. I used bifurcation theory, mathematical modeling, and machine learning for my work. Please check out a news release on our work at [Purdue Research Foundation news](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2019/Q4/an-engineering-approach-to-reduce-the-pain-of-chemotherapy.html), [Medical Xpress](https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-12-approach-pain-chemotherapy.html), and [HealthCanal](https://www.healthcanal.com/cancers/249612-an-engineering-approach-to-reduce-the-pain-of-chemotherapy.html). [Here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Parul_Verma7) is my researchgate profile. 

Before joining Purdue, I obtained my Bachelor of Technology degree in Chemical Engineering from **IIT Bombay**. There, I carried out a research project on moment closure methods for TNF-alpha signaling model with [Dr. Ganesh Viswanathan](https://www.che.iitb.ac.in/index.php/faculty/ganesh-viswanathan).
