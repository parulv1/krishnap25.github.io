1. Predicting chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN): CIPN is a prevalant, painful, and dose-limiting toxicity. Currently, there are no established cures for it due to a lack of complete understanding of its mechanism. Furthermore, different patients react differently to the treatment and there are no established predictors of CIPN. This project is in collaboration with clinicians at Riley Hospital, Indianapolis and Bruce Cooper, Bindley Bioscience Center, Purdue University. We analyzed metabolite profiles from the blood samples of pediatric patients who underwent chemotherapy treatment for leukemia. We then used support vector classifier along with recursive feature elimination to identify a small set of biomarker metabolites that can accurately predict CIPN susceptibility in these patients. We then built a model that can accurately predict CIPN susceptibility, using this small set of metabolites. Predicting CIPN susceptibility can help in preparing a personalized treatment for these patients and improve their quality of lives. I used [CARET](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) library in R for model building and feature selection.  

2. Investigating mechanism of CIPN:
